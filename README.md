 ## Description
 To start, I installed the MySQL package, the Inquirer package, and the Console.table Package.  I made a database in mysql.  I created several tables with different sets of data.  I joined tables to combine and display them on the screen.  

 The user can use the terminal to sort, add, and display employee data.  

 ## Installation 
 If you are interested in trying this application out, you can install MySQL, Inquirer, and console.table.  You will need to run the db file, schema file and the seeds file.  

 ## Usage 
 The project's intended use is to use the terminal to run an employee tracker that holds data. This project will display employee data.
